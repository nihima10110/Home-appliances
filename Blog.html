                <h4>Standard or Pro Ranges: Which one is best for Your HOME</h4>
                <p>If you’re a keen home cook, you may have wondered whether you
                     should purchase a pro range or stick to a standard model 
                     when you’re next updating your kitchen. While standard
                      ranges offer superb features, pro-style ranges tend to 
                      offer greater functionality. So, here we’ll explore 
                      some of the reasons why a pro range may be a good
                       option for you.One of the best ways to boost your cooking 
                       power is to use a pro range. These appliances typically have 
                       a far higher BTU output compared to standard ranges. They 
                       also typically have an expanded selection of cook modes 
                       including air fry and steam with features such as star 
                       shaped power burners and infrared broilers that can expand 
                       your cooking repertoire.</p>

                <h4>Understanding the Differences Between Frost-Free and Auto Defrost Freezers</h4>
                <p>A buildup of frost inside a freezer will affect the taste of frozen food, create bad odors, take up valuable space, and even cause damage to the appliance. Most modern freezers have features to deal with frost and these fall into two broad categories, frost-free and auto defrost.

                <h4>What is the Optimal Freezer Temperature?</h4>
                <p>
                    Having the ability to freeze food for long-term storage is something that our ancestors would find astonishing. Freezing food is a great way to prevent food waste, expand meal choices and save money at the same time. But, a freezer needs to be set at the optimal temperature to retain flavor and prevent spoilage. This is equally true if you have an upright or a chest freezer to prevent frost build-up, food melt, and freezer burn. In this article, we will take a closer look at how you can set your freezer temperature to keep your food fresher for longer.
                    Most experts agree that a freezer temperature of 0ºF (-18ºC) is the best environment for food preservation. At this temperature the food is free of bacteria, the risks of freezer burn are minimized, and the food will be safer to consume. It’s tempting to set the temperature lower because more or less in this case is always better, right? No, there are significant drawbacks if the freezer temperature is set too low. The compressor unit will need to work harder to maintain the lower temperature which has two consequences. First, when key components are overworked they tend to fail which can lead to an unexpected repair bill. Second, when the compressor is working harder it will consume more energy, and this will drive up the electric bill.

                <h4>Should You Stack Your Washer and Dryer?</h4>
                <p>
                    Make the Most of Small Spaces: If you don’t have the largest of homes, you may find that every square inch of your home needs to be put to work. When you have a small laundry room, being able to stack your appliances will free up floor space. With the average size of stackable laundry appliances averaging approximately two square feet, you can even have your appliances in a closet.
                    Efficient Cleaning: While a top loading machine may be the go-to in many homes, front loading washers actually use less energy and water. Rather than filling the whole drum with water, front loaders mix the minimal amount of water with the detergent for great cleaning performance and efficiency. Just bear in mind that if you choose a High Efficiency front loader, you’ll need to switch to a high efficiency detergent to avoid excess suds and cleaning issues.
                    Easier Access: If you have your washer on the bottom, with the dryer stacked above, it can be easier to remove the clothes. Whether you have a bad back or simply want to make life a little easier for yourself, stacking is a great option. With the space you have saved, you could even add a folding station to keep everything organized and neat.
                    Flexibility: If you like the idea of being able to rearrange your living space, stackable washer dryer sets provide superb flexibility. Most models can also be freestanding, so they can operate side by side. So, you’ll have the option to change your laundry room later if you prefer.

                <h4>How to Choose the Right Appliance Finish for Your Kitchen Design</h4>
                <p>Although stainless-steel finishes have been around for a while, they still work very well in a contemporary kitchen. This is still one of the most popular appliance finishes, and it will match most kitchen designs and decor choices. It’s easy to create a minimalist feel when stainless-steel finishes are matched with pure white cabinetry. An alternative is to add these contemporary finishes with a rustic kitchen to add a hint of modernity.
                    Black stainless-steel is a modern flashback to the heavy black appliances found in early industrial era kitchens. This is a perfect choice if you want an appliance finish that gives your kitchen a very modern edge. Black stainless-steel has a very different look and feel to standard stainless-steel finishes that is hard to describe. A more elegant feel can be created if the appliance is paired with darker cabinetry and isolated island surfaces. Black stainless-steel resists fingerprints, streaks, and smudges well, and the high-gloss finish shines after light polishing. If you don’t like a shiny black surface, you can create a Bat cave feel with matte black stainless-steel finishes.
                    Slate is a matte, low-gloss finish that makes the appliances look sleek and modern for a very up-to-date aesthetic appeal. Slate resists fingerprints, it’s easy to clean, and the surfaces are extremely durable. At first glance, these warm and charcoal hues may seem to be ill-suited to a kitchen setting, but they don’t clash with other tones and textures. So, if you want a neutral finish that doesn’t detract from a very unique kitchen, you may appreciate a slat finish for your appliances.

                <h4>5 Small Kitchen Appliances for Your New Home</h4>
               <p>Moving into a new home can be a daunting process and it can take a moment to figure out what you have and what you need. Some people focus on cool kitchen gadgets that won’t get much use, such as electric can openers and an egg maker. But, a manual can opener works fine and you can cook eggs in a pan of boiling water. In this article, we will look at five small kitchen appliances that will improve your daily life.

                1.  Immersion Blender
                This is a smaller handheld blender that you can easily move around the home or outdoors if you wish. It has a long handle with a sharp blade at the business end which is partially covered for your protection. The blade can be removed for cleaning and the partial cover will prevent most food splatters. When you’re cooking veggies or broth on the stove, you simply put the immersion blender in the pan and puree it to make the perfect soup. This is a great small appliance to create your favorite sauces too.
                
                2.  Coffee Grinder
                If you don’t drink coffee, you can skip this small appliance, but for many of us, it would be hard to start the day without our morning joe. Buying whole coffee beans and grinding them at home is a great way to extract the most flavor and aroma from your coffee. A fresh grind each morning will ensure that you never drink instant coffee again. Even a higher end coffee grinder is affordable and reliable which makes the purchase a no brainer.

                <h4>Electric vs. Induction Cooktop: Which Cooks Faster?</h4>
                <p>If you have the budget for the induction cooktop and magnetic cookware, it’s hard to not recommend these appliances. Professional chefs love induction cooking because it’s precise, quick and the daily clean down is very simple. When you have this level of control over the cooking temperatures you can melt chocolate or make delicate sauces easily. This is equally applicable when you need more heat quickly and in less than 15 minutes you can boil a large pot of water to make spaghetti.

                    The induction process uses a magnetic current to heat up the lower surfaces of cookware quickly. This is a direct heat transfer, there is no residual heat anywhere else on the induction cooktop. So, if you accidentally touch a surface you will not be burnt by a flame or heating element. This makes cooking with kids a real joy and you don’t need to wait for several minutes before you can use that skillet to get hot.
                    
                    A busy kitchen can be a very hot place to work and we experience some of that pressure when we cook for larger groups or in hotter summer months. But, an induction cooktop generates no heat in the way that an electric or gas model would. There is no need to consider preheating times if you are busy and you want to cook a meal from scratch. Once you set the induction hob, it will be ready to use almost instantaneously which is a real time saver. Cleaning is easy, the glass surface is smooth and it can be wiped clean with a soft cloth. There are no burners, grates or coils to remove, soak, clean, dry and replace.

There are many things to consider before you make your final purchase decision, so here we’ve compiled some top tips for your appliance shopping.
                    This must be your first step before you even set foot into a showroom. While you will need to have a rough idea of how much new appliances will cost, it is important that you have a realistic budget. If you’re planning a kitchen remodel, new appliances can be a significant portion of your budget. So, if you overspend, you may need to compromise in other areas of your renovation.

                     There is a vast choice of appliances on today’s market and the ones with the latest technology will have a higher price tag. So, if you head into the showroom without a budget in mind, you may be tempted to pick one with all the latest features.

                   this makes it crucial to keep your budget in your mind and only look at the appliances that are within your financial reach. If you do find a model with some interesting functions, you will need to assess the additional cost to determine if it is worth the extra cost
